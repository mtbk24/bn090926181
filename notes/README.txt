grbm and sbpl:  both good fits and errors.

copl:  obviously bad fit.

grbm+lpow and sbpl+lpow:  good fits.

copl+lpow:  PL doesn't match the BGO LLE or LAT data.

grbm+blackb:  with kT = 35.6, this is a good fit.  kT at lower temps didn't work.  Amplitudes reduced.  Best stats so far.


sbpl+blackb:  with kT = 29.9, this is a good fit.  kT at lower and higher temps didn't work.  Amplitudes reduced.  BBODY wasn't significant compared to the sbpl.  Stats not as good as grbm+blackb.

copl+blackb:  doesn't fit the high energy BGO, LLE or LAT data.  Not a good fit.

grbm+blackb+lpow:  good fit, errors and stats.  best so far.

sbpl+blackb+lpow:  good fit, errors and stats.  not as good as grbm+b+l.

copl+blackb+lpow:  PL didn't match the high-energy data.  If PL was brought to match the LLE and LAT data then the BBODY became insignificant.
